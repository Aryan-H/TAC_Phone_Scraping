# TAC_Phone_Scraping

This is web scraping tool developed in Python using jupyter notebook. This program fetches a phones name, price, review, and availabilty on the canadian Amazon website as well as potential accessories that can be purchased. To test this program download both the notebook file and the TAC database file which contains the TAC for many phones. I would recommend running this in Google Colab. To use, first upload the tacdb.csv file and just hit run on each cell and read the comments if you would like to understand functionality. The final cell will let you enter a TAC number and then all relevant information will be displayed. If you would like to find values you could use to test the program, refer to the tacdb.csv file or use 01294000 for an iPhone 4s. Thank you and take care!
